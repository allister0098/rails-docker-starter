# Rails Starter Kit

This project is a Rails starter kit designed to simplify the setup and initialization of a new Ruby on Rails application. Follow the steps below to generate the Rails code, start the Rails server, and access it.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Docker
- Make

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Rails application.

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

Run the following command to install Rails and generate the necessary code:

```sh
make init
```

This command will set up your Rails environment and generate the initial Rails codebase.

### Step 2: Start the Rails Server
After initializing the project, start the Rails server with the following command:

```sh
make up
```

### Step 3: Access the Application
Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser by navigating to:

```arduino
http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

You should see the Rails welcome page or the home page of your application, confirming that the server is running correctly.
